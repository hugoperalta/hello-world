# hello-world

Hi bros!

I started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 3 years ago.

After quitting for a long time, believing that my vocation was graphic design, I came back wanting to become a full-stack developer. Now I am learning in depth about different languages.

I started digging deeper into the ones I already knew, now I'm on my way to MySql, Sql, NoSql.
In a while I want to learn Back-End languages like php alongside laravel, nodejs and vuejs.

In the official page of microsoft I am learning C #.

1 month ago I learned Python in a basic way, I want to focus it in the future on machine learning.

I know that reading everything I intend to learn, you may be laughing, but I am trying very hard and no matter what happens, I will learn in time.
